I have suffered with pain in 90% of my body for too many years to remember when I was not in pain. This is no longer the case! The wonderful Dr. Adisa and my therapist, Mari, have helped me to be practically pain-free. Hanifat and Victoria are equally wonderful. They all work as a team to give me compassionate  care! I highly recommend RCA to anyone who needs physical therapy!!"
